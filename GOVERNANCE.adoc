= Project Wharf Governance
:toc: left
:icons: font

== Overview

Project Wharf is governed by a small group of Core Maintainers who make
decisions through consensus. This document outlines how decisions are made,
how maintainers are selected, and how the project operates.

== Decision Making

=== Consensus Model

We use a **Lazy Consensus** model:

1. Proposals are made via GitLab Issues or Merge Requests
2. A minimum 72-hour comment period is required for significant changes
3. If no objections, the proposal is accepted
4. If objections arise, discussion continues until consensus
5. If consensus cannot be reached, a vote is called

=== Voting

When consensus fails:

* **Simple majority** (>50%) for operational decisions
* **Supermajority** (>66%) for architectural changes
* **Unanimous** for security-critical changes and new Core maintainers

=== What Requires a Vote

| Decision Type | Threshold | Comment Period |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| Bug fix | Lazy consensus | 24 hours |
| New feature | Lazy consensus | 72 hours |
| Breaking change | Supermajority | 1 week |
| Architecture change | Supermajority | 2 weeks |
| New Core maintainer | Unanimous | 2 weeks |
| License change | Unanimous | 1 month |

== Roles

=== Core Maintainers

Core Maintainers have full commit access and are responsible for:

* Reviewing and merging contributions
* Releasing new versions
* Security response
* Project direction

Current Core Maintainers:

* **Jonathan D. A. Jewell** (@hyperpolymath) - Founder, Lead

=== Expert Contributors

Expert Contributors have elevated trust and can:

* Review Perimeter 3 contributions
* Approve non-critical MRs
* Triage issues

See CONTRIBUTING.adoc for eligibility.

=== Community Contributors

Anyone can contribute at the Community level. See CONTRIBUTING.adoc.

== Maintainer Selection

=== Becoming a Core Maintainer

1. **Nomination**: An existing Core maintainer nominates a candidate
2. **Evidence**: The nominator provides evidence of:
   - Significant contributions
   - Security awareness
   - Community standing
   - Long-term commitment
3. **Comment Period**: 2-week public comment period
4. **Vote**: Unanimous approval by existing Core
5. **Onboarding**: Access granted, added to MAINTAINERS.md

=== Maintainer Removal

A maintainer may be removed for:

* Inactivity (>6 months without contribution)
* Code of Conduct violation
* Security breach
* Voluntary resignation

Process:

1. Private discussion among Core
2. Opportunity for the maintainer to respond
3. Vote (supermajority for removal)
4. Access revoked, removed from MAINTAINERS.md

== Succession Planning

If all Core maintainers become unavailable:

1. Expert Contributors may elect new Core maintainers
2. If no Expert Contributors, the most active Community contributors
3. Repository may be transferred to a foundation (Software Freedom Conservancy)

== Financial Governance

=== Funding Sources

* Individual sponsors (GitHub Sponsors, Liberapay)
* Corporate sponsors
* Grants

=== Fund Allocation

| Category | Percentage |
|----------|------------|
| Development | 50% |
| Security audits | 25% |
| Infrastructure | 15% |
| Documentation | 10% |

=== Transparency

* All sponsorships >$100 are publicly acknowledged
* Quarterly financial reports published
* Annual audit for funds >$10,000

== Code of Conduct Enforcement

See CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc for the full Code of Conduct.

=== Enforcement Committee

The Core Maintainers serve as the Enforcement Committee.

=== Conflict of Interest

If a Core maintainer is involved in an incident:

* They recuse themselves from the investigation
* Remaining Core decides
* If only one Core remains, an Expert Contributor is elevated

This governance document may be amended by:

1. Proposal via Merge Request
