## Repository Focus
- `project-wharf` is the Sovereign Web Hypervisor — immutable CMS infrastructure.
- This is a Rhodium Standard Repository; obey Rhodium policies, maintain `.bot_directives/`, and keep `.machine_readable/` authoritative.
- Prefer to keep generated files out of source control, and regenerate them with the documented commands before committing.

## Architecture
- **Wharf** = Offline admin CLI (your machine) — crypto, fleet management, mooring, integrity
- **Yacht** = Online runtime agent (the server) — HTTP API, DB proxy, firewall, eBPF
- **Mooring** = Secure sync channel: init → verify → rsync → commit

## Workflow
1. Inspect `.machine_readable/STATE.scm` for blockers and next actions.
2. Respect any constraints listed inside `.machine_readable/AGENTIC.scm` when tooling changes are requested.
3. After finishing edits, update STATE with your outcomes and commit with a concise, imperative message.

## Security Model
- Ed448 + ML-DSA-87 hybrid signatures (post-quantum safe)
- BLAKE3 file integrity, SHAKE3-512 provenance hashing
- XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD, HKDF-SHA3-256 key derivation
- Argon2id password hashing (512 MiB, 8 iter, 4 lanes — Wharf only)
- AST-aware SQL proxy blocks injection at wire level
- Fail-closed: if it can't verify, it blocks

## Integration

- **panic-attack**: Weekly security scan via `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`
- **hypatia**: Neurosymbolic CI/CD via `.github/workflows/hypatia-scan.yml`
- **gitbot-fleet**: Bot directives in `.bot_directives/` (8 bots enrolled)
- **verisimdb-data**: Scan results ingested via repository_dispatch
- **echidna**: Formal verification via echidnabot directive

## Delivery Promises
- Mention in summaries whether STATE, `contractiles/`, or `.bot_directives/` changed.
- Keep this file in sync with the repository's status; update it if the governance changes.
