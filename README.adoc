== The Sovereign Web Hypervisor

image::docs/wharf-architecture.png[Wharf Architecture,align="center"]

*Wharf* is a revolutionary approach to Content Management System (CMS) security that separates administration from runtime. Instead of plugins with full system access running on your live site, Wharf uses an *offline controller* (the Wharf) and a *read-only runtime* (the Yacht) connected via a Zero Trust mesh network.

=== Core Philosophy

[quote]
The gun should not be in the safe.

Traditional CMS security is like storing the vault's drill, dynamite, and blueprints *inside* the vault. If an attacker gets in, they use your own tools against you.

Wharf inverts this:

* *The Yacht (Live Site)*: A neutered runtime. It serves content but cannot install plugins, edit code, or change configuration.
* *The Wharf (Controller)*: Your offline workshop. It holds the keys, runs diagnostics, and makes all administrative decisions.
* *The Mooring*: A cryptographically secured connection that temporarily allows the Wharf to sync state to the Yacht.

== Key Features

=== Database "Virtual Sharding"

The Yacht Agent acts as a SQL proxy, parsing queries using an *Abstract Syntax Tree* (not regex!) to enforce security policies:

* *Mutable Tables* (Blue Zone): Content like comments and orders—allowed to write
* *Immutable Tables* (Red Zone): Config like users and plugins—blocked unless from Wharf
* *Hybrid Tables* (Grey Zone): Mixed content like `wp_options`—conditional rules

[source,sql]
----
-- ALLOWED: User comment
INSERT INTO wp_comments (comment_content) VALUES ('Great post!')

-- BLOCKED: New admin user
INSERT INTO wp_users (user_login, user_pass) VALUES ('hacker', 'password')
-- Error: Policy violation: write to immutable table 'wp_users'
----

=== Filesystem Immutability

The Yacht filesystem is mounted read-only with specific writable "playgrounds":

|===
| Path | Type | Purpose

| `/wp-content/uploads` | Persistent, No PHP | User media files
| `/wp-content/cache` | RAM Disk (tmpfs) | Temporary cache—wipes on restart
| `/wp-content/plugins` | OverlayFS | "The Lie"—plugins think they write, but it's ephemeral
|===

=== HTTP Header Airlock

A Rust-based HTTP proxy strips dangerous headers and injects security headers:

[source]
----
# Stripped (Information Leakage)
- Server: Apache/2.4.41
- X-Powered-By: PHP/8.1

# Injected (Security Hardening)
+ Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
+ Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
+ Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=()
----

=== Zero Trust Networking (Nebula)

Admin ports are *invisible* to the public internet. The Yacht's management API (port 9000) only responds to devices with valid Nebula certificates.

== Quick Start

=== Prerequisites

* Rust (via rustup)
* Podman (or Docker)
* Just (command runner)
* Optional: Nebula, named-checkzone (bind-utils)

=== Installation

git clone https://gitlab.com/hyperpolymath/wharf.git
cd wharf

# Initialize the workspace
just init

# Build everything

{
  "domain": "example.com",
  "ip": "192.0.2.1",
  "ipv6": "2001:db8::1",
  "nameserver": "ns1.example.com",
  "nameserver2": "ns2.example.com",
  "rpemail": "hostmaster.example.com",
  "serial": "2025112601",
  "ttl": "3600",
  "nsttl": "86400"
}
EOF

# Build DNS zone files
just build-zones

# Audit the generated zone
just audit-zone dist/example.db example.com

# Detect if dedicated or shared hosting
just detect-env example.com 192.0.2.1
----

== DNS Zone Templates

Wharf includes four DNS templates for different environments:

|===
| Template | Use Case | Key Difference

| `simple.tpl` | Modern minimum viable | Basic records + email deliverability (SPF, DMARC, CAA)
| `shared.tpl` | Shared/Virtual hosting | Uses CNAMEs, includes provider SPF, no SSHFP
| `standard.tpl` | Dedicated IP | Explicit FTP A record, full control
| `maximalist.tpl` | Enterprise/Security-focused | DANE, SSHFP, OPENPGPKEY, HTTPS/SVCB, LOC
|===

== CMS Adapters

Wharf includes adapters for popular CMS platforms:

=== WordPress

[source,bash]
----
# Copy the DB proxy drop-in
cp adapters/wordpress/db.php /var/www/html/wp-content/db.php

# The Yacht Agent must be running on 127.0.0.1:3307
----

=== Drupal

[source,bash]
----
# Include the settings override
echo "include_once '/opt/wharf/adapters/drupal/settings.php';" >> sites/default/settings.php
----

=== Others

* Joomla (adapter included)
* Moodle (adapter included)
* Generic LAMP (customizable adapter)

== Security Model

=== Cryptographic Primitives

Wharf uses a *post-quantum hybrid* signature scheme and modern cryptographic primitives:

|===
| Primitive | Algorithm | Purpose

| *Hybrid Signatures* | Ed448 + ML-DSA-87 (Dilithium5) | All mooring requests and responses — both must verify
| *File Integrity* | BLAKE3 | Fast hashing for filesystem manifests
| *Provenance Hashing* | SHAKE3-512 (FIPS 202) | Long-term provenance and KDF input
| *Symmetric Encryption* | XChaCha20-Poly1305 | AEAD for secrets in transit
| *Key Derivation* | HKDF-SHAKE512 | Derive per-session keys
| *Password Hashing* | Argon2id (512 MiB, 8 iter, 4 lanes) | Wharf controller only — never on Yacht
| *Random Generation* | ChaCha20-DRBG (512-bit seed) | All key generation and nonces
|===

The hybrid signature scheme ensures that *both* Ed448 (classical) and ML-DSA-87 (post-quantum) signatures must verify. An attacker must break *both* algorithms — quantum or classical — to forge a signature.

=== Mooring Protocol

The Wharf controller syncs state to the Yacht via a four-phase HTTP protocol:

[source]
----
1. INIT     Wharf → Yacht   "I want to sync layers X, Y, Z"  (signed)
2. VERIFY   Wharf → Yacht   "Here's my BLAKE3 manifest"       (per layer)
3. RSYNC    Wharf → Yacht   SSH-based file transfer            (delta only)
4. COMMIT   Wharf → Yacht   "Lock it in, create snapshot"     (signed)
----

All init and commit requests carry hybrid signatures. The Yacht verifies both Ed448 and ML-DSA-87 components before accepting.

=== Threat Model

Wharf assumes:

* The live server (Yacht) is *hostile territory*
* Attackers may have SQL injection or file upload vulnerabilities
* Network is *untrusted* (even internal networks)

=== Protections

|===
| Attack Vector | Wharf Defense

| SQL Injection → New Admin User | Database proxy blocks writes to `wp_users`
| File Upload → PHP Shell | Uploads directory has `php_flag engine off`
| Plugin Backdoor | Plugins directory is read-only (OverlayFS)
| Config Tampering | `wp-config.php` changes trigger instant revert
| Network Sniffing | Nebula mesh encrypts all admin traffic
| Signature Forgery | Ed448 + ML-DSA-87 hybrid — quantum-resistant
| Key Compromise | Argon2id (512 MiB) protects stored keys
|===

== Container Deployment

Wharf uses hardened Chainguard container images with the hyperpolymath container toolchain:

|===
| Component | Image | Role

| Builder | `cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base:latest` | Compilation and asset building
| Runtime (Agent) | `cgr.dev/chainguard/static:latest` | Minimal distroless runtime
| Web Server | `cgr.dev/chainguard/nginx:latest` | Hardened nginx
| Database | `cgr.dev/chainguard/mariadb:latest` | MariaDB with policy enforcement
|===

Orchestration uses `selur-compose` with the `vordr` container runtime, `rokur` secrets management, and `cerro-torre` image signing. See `infra/selur-compose.yaml`.

[source,bash]
----
# Build container images
just container-build

# Deploy with selur-compose
just deploy-selur

# Sign images with cerro-torre
just sign-images
----

Wharf uses https://nickel-lang.org/[Nickel] for declarative configuration:

* `configs/fleet.ncl` - Define your Yachts
* `configs/policies/database.ncl` - Database virtual sharding rules
* `configs/policies/airlock.ncl` - HTTP header rules
