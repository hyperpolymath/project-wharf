== The Sovereign Web Hypervisor

image::docs/wharf-architecture.png[Wharf Architecture,align="center"]

*Wharf* is a revolutionary approach to Content Management System (CMS) security that separates administration from runtime. Instead of plugins with full system access running on your live site, Wharf uses an *offline controller* (the Wharf) and a *read-only runtime* (the Yacht) connected via a Zero Trust mesh network.

=== Core Philosophy

[quote]
The gun should not be in the safe.

Traditional CMS security is like storing the vault's drill, dynamite, and blueprints *inside* the vault. If an attacker gets in, they use your own tools against you.

Wharf inverts this:

* *The Yacht (Live Site)*: A neutered runtime. It serves content but cannot install plugins, edit code, or change configuration.
* *The Wharf (Controller)*: Your offline workshop. It holds the keys, runs diagnostics, and makes all administrative decisions.
* *The Mooring*: A cryptographically secured connection that temporarily allows the Wharf to sync state to the Yacht.

== Key Features

=== Database "Virtual Sharding"

The Yacht Agent acts as a SQL proxy, parsing queries using an *Abstract Syntax Tree* (not regex!) to enforce security policies:

* *Mutable Tables* (Blue Zone): Content like comments and orders—allowed to write
* *Immutable Tables* (Red Zone): Config like users and plugins—blocked unless from Wharf
* *Hybrid Tables* (Grey Zone): Mixed content like `wp_options`—conditional rules

[source,sql]
----
-- ALLOWED: User comment
INSERT INTO wp_comments (comment_content) VALUES ('Great post!')

-- BLOCKED: New admin user
INSERT INTO wp_users (user_login, user_pass) VALUES ('hacker', 'password')
-- Error: Policy violation: write to immutable table 'wp_users'
----

=== Filesystem Immutability

The Yacht filesystem is mounted read-only with specific writable "playgrounds":

|===
| Path | Type | Purpose

| `/wp-content/uploads` | Persistent, No PHP | User media files
| `/wp-content/cache` | RAM Disk (tmpfs) | Temporary cache—wipes on restart
| `/wp-content/plugins` | OverlayFS | "The Lie"—plugins think they write, but it's ephemeral
|===

=== HTTP Header Airlock

A Rust-based HTTP proxy strips dangerous headers and injects security headers:

[source]
----
# Stripped (Information Leakage)
- Server: Apache/2.4.41
- X-Powered-By: PHP/8.1

# Injected (Security Hardening)
+ Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
+ Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
+ Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=()
----

=== Zero Trust Networking (Nebula)

Admin ports are *invisible* to the public internet. The Yacht's management API (port 9000) only responds to devices with valid Nebula certificates.

== Quick Start

=== Prerequisites

* Rust (via rustup)
* Podman (or Docker)
* Just (command runner)
* Optional: Nebula, named-checkzone (bind-utils)

=== Installation

[source,bash]
----
# Clone the repository
git clone https://gitlab.com/hyperpolymath/wharf.git
cd wharf

# Initialize the workspace
just init

# Build everything
just build
----

=== Basic Usage

[source,bash]
----
# Create zone file variables
cat > vars/example.json << 'EOF'
{
  "domain": "example.com",
  "ip": "192.0.2.1",
  "ipv6": "2001:db8::1",
  "nameserver": "ns1.example.com",
  "nameserver2": "ns2.example.com",
  "rpemail": "hostmaster.example.com",
  "serial": "2025112601",
  "ttl": "3600",
  "nsttl": "86400"
}
EOF

# Build DNS zone files
just build-zones

# Audit the generated zone
just audit-zone dist/example.db example.com

# Detect if dedicated or shared hosting
just detect-env example.com 192.0.2.1
----

== DNS Zone Templates

Wharf includes four DNS templates for different environments:

|===
| Template | Use Case | Key Difference

| `simple.tpl` | Modern minimum viable | Basic records + email deliverability (SPF, DMARC, CAA)
| `shared.tpl` | Shared/Virtual hosting | Uses CNAMEs, includes provider SPF, no SSHFP
| `standard.tpl` | Dedicated IP | Explicit FTP A record, full control
| `maximalist.tpl` | Enterprise/Security-focused | DANE, SSHFP, OPENPGPKEY, HTTPS/SVCB, LOC
|===

== CMS Adapters

Wharf includes adapters for popular CMS platforms:

=== WordPress

[source,bash]
----
# Copy the DB proxy drop-in
cp adapters/wordpress/db.php /var/www/html/wp-content/db.php

# The Yacht Agent must be running on 127.0.0.1:3307
----

=== Drupal

[source,bash]
----
# Include the settings override
echo "include_once '/opt/wharf/adapters/drupal/settings.php';" >> sites/default/settings.php
----

=== Others

* Joomla (adapter included)
* Moodle (adapter included)
* Generic LAMP (customizable adapter)

== Security Model

=== Threat Model

Wharf assumes:

* The live server (Yacht) is *hostile territory*
* Attackers may have SQL injection or file upload vulnerabilities
* Network is *untrusted* (even internal networks)

=== Protections

|===
| Attack Vector | Wharf Defense

| SQL Injection → New Admin User | Database proxy blocks writes to `wp_users`
| File Upload → PHP Shell | Uploads directory has `php_flag engine off`
| Plugin Backdoor | Plugins directory is read-only (OverlayFS)
| Config Tampering | `wp-config.php` changes trigger instant revert
| Network Sniffing | Nebula mesh encrypts all admin traffic
|===

== Configuration Reference

Wharf uses https://nickel-lang.org/[Nickel] for declarative configuration:

* `configs/fleet.ncl` - Define your Yachts
* `configs/policies/database.ncl` - Database virtual sharding rules
* `configs/policies/airlock.ncl` - HTTP header rules
* `configs/policies/filesystem.ncl` - File immutability policies
* `configs/policies/auth.ncl` - FIDO2 and session policies
* `configs/policies/network.ncl` - Nebula mesh and firewall rules
