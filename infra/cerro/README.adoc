= Cerro Torre Manifests (Project Wharf)

These `.ctp` manifests define the supply-chain verified images for the Yacht runtime.
They are intentionally strict and require source hashes and provenance before building.

== Workflow

. Fill in `TO_BE_FILLED_WITH_REAL_HASH` entries with real hashes.
. Run `ct verify` on each manifest.
. Build and publish OCI images from the verified manifests.
. Update `infra/svalinn/yacht.yaml` tags when promoting new releases.

== Manifests

* `yacht-web.ctp` — OpenLiteSpeed + PHP runtime
* `yacht-agent.ctp` — Wharf agent (Rust, distroless)
* `yacht-mariadb.ctp` — MariaDB for WordPress
* `yacht-redis.ctp` — Redis cache
* `yacht-memcached.ctp` — Memcached cache
* `yacht-arango.ctp` — ArangoDB graph/document store
