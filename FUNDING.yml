# Funding Philosophy
#
# Project Wharf follows the Solidarity Economics model:
#
# 1. **Transparency**: All funding is publicly documented
# 2. **Sustainability**: We seek recurring sponsorship over one-time donations
# 3. **Fairness**: Contributors are compensated based on contribution weight
# 4. **Independence**: No single sponsor controls project direction
#
# Funds are used for:
# - Security audits
# - Infrastructure costs
# - Contributor compensation
# - Documentation and outreach
#
# Financial reports published quarterly in GOVERNANCE.adoc
